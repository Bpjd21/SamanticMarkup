        Sometimes people say important things
        <!-- description of next section -->
        <br />
        You need to document important things that people say so you can sound smart when it's necessary.

    <!-- title for next section -->
    When it comes to HTML, there are some things you just shouldn't do
    <!-- description -->
    At least, not anymore...

    <!-- title for next item -->
    Want bold text?
    <!-- make 'right way' bold first the wrong way, then the right way -->
    There's a wrong way and a right way. Always use the right way!

    <!-- title for next item -->
    Maybe you need some italics?
    <!-- make 'like this' italic using the wrong method. Make 'right way' italic using the correct method -->
    Again, it used to be done like this. This is wrong. This is the right way.

    <!-- title for next item -->
    Separation of concerns
    <!-- description -->
    The wrong way tags above are deprecated and should not be used. HTML should be used to mark-up or organize your content. It should not be used to style your content or interact with it. Those are the jobs of CSS and JavaScript!

    <!-- title for next section -->
    Links
    <!-- make either 'place' in the next body of text a link to your favorite site. (keep it appropriate) -->
    Links are one of the most important parts of the web. They help you navigate from place to place on the internet.

    <!-- title for next section -->
    Sections
    <!-- go back through and group each section correctly
         stretch: give each group a class that properly reflects what they represent -->
    Section elements are good for grouping elements that belong together. You can also use div's for
